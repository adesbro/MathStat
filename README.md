# MathStat #

This library has been created to contain code to support some statistical calculations that I require for my research projects.

I'm happy if people want to contribute, but I've only just started this and the content may change dramatically.

## Contents ##

This project contains code for:

- Frequency tables
- Cumulative distribution
- Frequency analysis
- Pseudo-random sampling
- CryptoRandom (a more random random)
